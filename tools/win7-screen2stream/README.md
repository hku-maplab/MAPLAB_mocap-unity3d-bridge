As of this moment we haven't been able to get a (very) low-latency solution for streaming to a tablet. BUT TeamViewer has! So for now we recommend you install TeamViewer on the tablet and pc and use it to mirror your display :)

Requirements:
----

* FFMPEG
Expected in PATH or c:\ffmpeg\bin

Usage:
----

* Run send_stream.bat (double click it)
* Provide IP address of remote player (ex, tablet)
* Point the videoplayer (on tablet) to udp://@:5000 or (...)
